# New Track Lately

This is a thing I made for people to check what songs their Facebook friends have most recently listened to. It's interesting to see what awful taste my friends have. Originally, I thought it'd be a good way of gathering new music to listen to, but then I realised that most of my friends listen to really really awful music, so it doesn't really work in the way I intended. Maybe if I add in a shame button, to share the fact that friends have listened to particular tracks it would be a bit more useful, and encourage everyone to listen to better music (or not listen to music most people find objectionable). Ah well. here's the source, enjoy it.
